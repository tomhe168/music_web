Information we collect<br><br>A. The following is Information which you provide to us directly:<br><br>2.1. Registration Information<br><br>2.1.1. When you register an account on the Services, we may collect Information such as your name, password, email address, and social network ID (if you have signed up using a social network account (e.g. Facebook or Google)).<br>2.1.2. Once your account has been registered, your name, username and profile picture (if you have signed up using your Social Network ID) will automatically be displayed on your profile page and will be available to other users through the Services.

In addition to your name and username, which are automatically displayed on your profile page, you may provide additional Information on your profile page such as your profile picture (if not already available via your sign up using your Social Network ID), date of birth, gender, location and other information about yourself and your interests.<br>2.2.2. Any such Information which you add to your profile page (except for date of birth and gender) on the Services becomes publicly available. Please exercise personal discretion in how much Information you choose to share.<br><br>2.3. Content which you upload to the Services, which allows others to identify you (e.g. photos of you, audio recordings or text containing your name, voice, status updates, comments on content which refer to you).<br><br>2.4. Communications between you and us (e.g. your reply to our service updates, emails to you, and support tickets).<br><br>B. The following is Information which other users provide about you:<br><br>2.5.

Other Information which we receive when running the Services:<br><br>2.6. Information<br><br>2.6.1. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. These tools collect information sent by your device including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Services. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.<br><br>2.7. Cookies and similar technologies<br><br>2.7.1. The Services may contain “cookies”, clear gifs (also known as “web beacons” or “web bugs”), or similar technology. A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies, or where you are a resident of the European Economic Area, if you have provided your consent to the use of cookies.<br><br>2.7.2. The Services use cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are developed to customise your experience with our website and Services. Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some services and portions of this website may not function properly.<br><br>2.8. Log file information<br><br>2.8.1.

When you use the Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Services, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our users which then helps us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.<br><br>2.9. Device identifiers<br><br>2.9.1. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Services, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.<br><br>2.9.2. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Services and may help us or others provide reports or personalised content and ads. Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.<br><br>3. How we use your Information<br><br>3.1.

We may share your Information with the following parties:<br><br>a) Related Entities: These are businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that we are part of, or that become part of that group.<br><br>b) Service Providers: These are our third party contractors. We engage them to assist us in providing and managing aspects of the Services, such as developing the Services’ features and functionality, marketing, processing payments, processing data or statistics, hosting content, providing server space, reviewing content for compliance with our Terms of Use, and legal advice.<br><br>c) Third Party Advertisers: We may provide Information to third party advertisers so that they can notify you of events or products which may be of interest to you. For instance, you may be notified of an upcoming concert or product release.<br><br>d) Analytics Services: We may use third party analytics providers and products to obtain, compile and analyse Information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data), and may provide such Information to these analytics providers for the purpose of obtaining statistics and other information about how users are using and interacting with the Services. One of our analytics providers is Google Analytics and more information on their privacy policy is available at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.<br><br>e) We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymised data with other parties.

We require that all parties with whom we share Information to implement adequate levels of protection in order to protect such Information.<br><br>4.3. If you delete Information or content which you have uploaded or posted on the Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Services, unless you contact us to request permanent deletion as per Section 8.3 below.<br><br>4.4. We may also share your Information with third parties in the following circumstances:<br><br>(a) Change of control: If the ownership of our business changes or we undertake a reorganisation of our business, we may transfer your Information and content to the new owners so they can continue to operate the Services. The new owners may subsequently make changes to this Privacy Policy;<br><br>(b) If permitted or required by law: We may disclose Information if we believe that such disclosure is required or permitted by law (e.g. by responding to requests from government authorities, or disclosure pursuant to court orders or other legal demands); and<br><br>(c) To protect interests: We may disclose Information if we determine it is necessary to enforce or protect our rights or the property or personal safety of the users of the Service (e.g. to enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, or to prevent or take action against illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats or breaches).<br><br>5.

We will ensure that where we transfer your personal data outside of HongKong, the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, we will put in place all necessary safeguards to protect that personal data, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. This includes the entities’ making of reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risk to your Information, and removing the Information as soon as it is reasonable to assume that its retention is no longer necessary.<br><br>5.2. Currently, the countries to which Information is transferred for the purpose of storage on cloud servers are HongKong and the United States of America. We may update this list periodically to reflect any new locations where your Information may be stored.<br><br>5.3.
